# IntonationApp (User's Guide)

This is a simple intonation app that extracts, draws, and overlays a learner's pitch on top of a model speaker's pitch. The goal of this app is to help language learners recognize the difference in pitch movements in order to better help them learn the pitch of the language they are learning. 

# Requirements 
Here are a list of requirements needed to run the program. No specific versions needed; just download the latest ones. These requirements are also listed in Requirements.txt

* Python 3.7 or higher
* numpy
* pYAAPT
* Aubio
* dtwalign
* DearPyGUI
* PyAudio
* playsound
* Wave
* tempfile
* os

# Running as .exe file (recommended)
In the dist folder, click on the main.exe file. This should run the application on your computer without the need to install anything else. 
Note: This does not work on a Mac and has only been tested on Windows 10. 

# Running as .py file
The only file you need to run in main.py. Use pip to install all required third-party packages listed above: `pip -r requirements.txt`

If using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime, simply run the main.py file

If you don't have an IDE: 
* Open up the terminal on your computer
* cd to the appropirate folder (e.g. cd /Users/aprilmelody/Desktop/PythonIntonationApp)
* type in python main.py 

# Tutorial Walkthrough
Using the application is simple! Here's a step-by-step:
* First, upload a .wav file of a model speaker
* Then, click on "extract pitch" to see the model speaker's pitch movement
* Take note of the model speaker's pitch movements and record yourself saying the same sentence using the 'record' and 'stop' buttons. Please make sure you have a microphone on your device!
* Finally, click on "extract your pitch" to see an overlay of your pitch on top of the model speaker's speech 
* Have fun!

Tips:
* Zoom in or zoom out on the graph by using the mouse wheel button
* Show/hide a plot by clicking on the legend
* Delete a plot you no longer want by right clicking on the legend
* Right click on the graph for a whole bunch of other options

# Known Issues
* If your recording is too long, the app will ask you to re-record your audio file

# Future Work
* A vline series that shows users at which point of the pitch contour they are at when playing the file
* Ability to scrub back and forth to play only specific parts of the audio file
